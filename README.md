The particular study aims to predict features affecting smartphone prices with the usage of machine learning regression algorithms. Our team developed Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor models including variables from the scraped website. The main purpose is to create comparable models and determine the best one in the end. Since our aim is to predict smartphone prices and observe main features affecting them, as for our dependent variable we decided to choose prices of smartphones respectively. As we performed 3 regression models we received the best cross-validated MSE score on our Linear Regression model (0.63), which outperformed the cross-validated MSE scores of Decision Tree (0.65) and Random Forest (0.68). The result is expectable since we used the forward selection approach and performed heavy feature engineering to establish a linear relationship between price and other variables.
